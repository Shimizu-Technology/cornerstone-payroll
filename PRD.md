# PRD: Cornerstone Payroll

**Project:** Cornerstone Payroll
**Client:** Cornerstone Tax Services (Guam)
**Author:** Jerry (drafted), Leon Shimizu (review)
**Status:** Draft
**Created:** 2026-02-04

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Cornerstone Tax Services currently processes payroll using a combination of Excel spreadsheets and QuickBooks. This workflow has significant pain points:

1. **QuickBooks doesn't natively support Guam** — Leon has to register with a mainland US address, and staff must manually remove/fix addresses on all printed checks
2. **Manual tax calculations** — Spreadsheets for computing withholdings, prone to human error
3. **No single system** — Data lives across multiple spreadsheets and QuickBooks, making reporting and auditing difficult
4. **Check printing friction** — QuickBooks is primarily used just for printing checks, which is expensive overhead for that one feature

### Why Now?

- Cornerstone wants to grow their payroll services to more clients
- The manual process doesn't scale beyond a handful of employees
- Guam-specific payroll software effectively doesn't exist (confirmed: Gusto, Check.com, ADP APIs all exclude US Territories)
- This represents a market gap and potential SaaS opportunity for Guam businesses

---

## 2. Goals

### Phase 1 — Internal Payroll (MVP)
Process payroll for Cornerstone's own 4 employees. Replace Excel + QuickBooks entirely for internal use.

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] Calculate gross pay from hours (biweekly)
- [ ] Compute all required Guam tax withholdings correctly
- [ ] Generate printable pay stubs (PDF)
- [ ] Generate printable payroll checks (PDF)
- [ ] Maintain payroll history and reporting

### Phase 2 — Client Payroll
Expand to process payroll for Cornerstone's tax clients (multiple companies).

### Phase 3 — Direct Deposit & Advanced Features
ACH direct deposit, quarterly filing reports (941-GU), W-2GU generation, bank reconciliation.

## 3. User Roles

| Role | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Cornerstone owner/CEO | Full access — manage companies, employees, run payroll, system settings |
| **Payroll Manager** | Cornerstone staff | Run payroll, manage employees, view reports. Cannot change system settings. |
| **Employee** | Person being paid | View own pay stubs, update personal info (future: self-service portal) |

---

## 4. Guam Tax Structure

This is the core domain knowledge. Guam's tax system is defined by Section 31 of the Organic Act of Guam (1950):

> "The income tax laws in force in the United States shall be the income tax laws of Guam, substituting 'Guam' for 'United States' where applicable."

### Payroll Deductions (Employee Side)

| Deduction | Rate | Wage Base | Notes |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------|
| **Guam Territorial Income Tax** | Federal brackets | No cap | Uses IRS Publication 15-T withholding tables. Filed with Guam Dept of Revenue & Taxation, NOT the IRS. |
| **Social Security (OASDI)** | 6.2% | $168,600 (2025) | Same as federal. Stops withholding at wage base. |
| **Medicare** | 1.45% | No cap | Additional 0.9% on wages over $200K (single) |

### Employer-Side Taxes

| Tax | Rate | Wage Base | Notes |
|-----|------|-----------|-------|
| **Social Security (OASDI)** | 6.2% | $168,600 | Employer match |
| **Medicare** | 1.45% | No cap | Employer match (no additional 0.9%) |

### Key Simplification
Unlike mainland US payroll, there is **no separate state tax**. The Guam Territorial Income Tax IS the income tax. One jurisdiction, one set of brackets. This makes the tax engine dramatically simpler.

### Tax Filing
- Employers file with **Guam Department of Revenue and Taxation** (guamtax.com)
- Use Guam equivalents of federal forms (e.g., Form 941-GU instead of 941)
- W-2GU instead of W-2 at year-end
- Due dates mirror federal schedule

- Daily overtime not required (unlike California)

### 5.3 Payroll Processing

**Workflow:**
1. **Select pay period** — Start/end dates (biweekly)
2. **Review time entries** — All employees' hours for the period
3. **Calculate payroll** — System computes:
   - Gross pay (hours × rate, or salary ÷ 26)
   - Overtime pay (OT hours × rate × 1.5)
   - Pre-tax deductions (retirement, health insurance)
   - Guam Territorial Income Tax withholding
   - Social Security withholding
   - Medicare withholding
   - Post-tax deductions
   - Net pay
4. **Review & approve** — Manager reviews all calculations before committing
5. **Commit payroll** — Locks the pay period, generates pay stubs and checks
6. **Print checks** — Generate PDF checks for printing

**Payroll run status:** `draft` → `calculated` → `approved` → `committed`

### 5.4 Pay Stub Generation (PDF)

Each pay stub includes:
- Company name and address
- Employee name and address
- Pay period dates
- Earnings breakdown (regular, overtime, holiday, etc.)
- Deductions breakdown (taxes, insurance, retirement, etc.)
- YTD (year-to-date) totals for all categories
- Net pay

### 5.5 Check Printing (PDF)

- Check number (sequential)
- Pay stub attached (bottom portion of check)

**Printing options:**
- Print on blank check stock (MICR toner for bank line — future)
- Print on pre-printed check stock (overlay payee/amount/date only)

### 5.6 Reporting

**Standard reports:**
- Payroll register (all employees for a pay period)
- Individual employee pay history
- Tax withholding summary (by quarter)
- Year-to-date totals
- Employer tax liability summary

**Future reports (Phase 2+):**
- 941-GU quarterly filing report
- W-2GU annual summary
- General ledger export

## 6. Technical Architecture

### Option A: Module in Cornerstone Tax (Recommended for Phase 1)
Add payroll as a module within the existing Cornerstone Tax app:
- **Backend:** Rails API (already exists at `cornerstone-tax/backend/`)
- **Frontend:** React + Vite (already exists at `cornerstone-tax/frontend/`)
- **Auth:** Clerk (already configured)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (already running)

**Pros:** Shared auth, shared employee/client data, one deployment
**Cons:** Larger monolith, payroll concerns mixed with tax prep

### Option B: Standalone App
Separate Rails API + React frontend, own database.

**Pros:** Clean separation, independently deployable
**Cons:** Duplicate auth, need to sync employee data, more infrastructure

### Recommendation
**Start with Option A** (module in Cornerstone). The employee and client data already exists there. If payroll grows into its own SaaS product later, extract it then. Don't over-engineer upfront.

### Database Schema (New Tables)

### Tax Calculation Engine

The tax engine is a service class that:
1. Looks up the current year's tax table
2. Computes annualized income from the pay period
3. Applies federal/Guam withholding brackets (from IRS Pub 15-T)
4. Calculates per-period withholding
5. Handles Social Security wage base cap (stop withholding after $168,600 YTD)
6. Handles Additional Medicare Tax threshold

```ruby
# Example: GuamTaxCalculator
class GuamTaxCalculator
  def initialize(tax_year:, filing_status:, allowances:, pay_frequency:)
    @table = TaxTable.find_by(tax_year: tax_year, filing_status: filing_status)
    @pay_frequency = pay_frequency
    @periods_per_year = PAY_FREQUENCIES[pay_frequency] # biweekly = 26
    @allowance_amount = ALLOWANCE_AMOUNTS[tax_year] # per allowance per year
  end

  def calculate(gross_pay:, ytd_gross: 0, ytd_ss_tax: 0)
    # 1. Annualize
    annual_gross = gross_pay * @periods_per_year

    # 2. Subtract allowances
    taxable = annual_gross - (@allowances * @allowance_amount)

    # 3. Apply brackets
    annual_tax = apply_brackets(taxable)

    # 4. De-annualize
    territorial_tax = (annual_tax / @periods_per_year).round(2)

    # 5. Social Security (check wage base)
    ss_taxable = [gross_pay, [SS_WAGE_BASE - ytd_gross, 0].max].min
    social_security = (ss_taxable * SS_RATE).round(2)

    # 6. Medicare
    medicare = (gross_pay * MEDICARE_RATE).round(2)
    if ytd_gross + gross_pay > ADDITIONAL_MEDICARE_THRESHOLD
      additional = [gross_pay, ytd_gross + gross_pay - ADDITIONAL_MEDICARE_THRESHOLD].min
      medicare += (additional * ADDITIONAL_MEDICARE_RATE).round(2)
    end

    { territorial_tax:, social_security:, medicare: }
  end
end
```

- 941-GU quarterly filing report generation
- W-2GU annual generation
- Bank reconciliation module
- Employee self-service portal

---

## 8. Decision: Build as Module vs Standalone

**Decision: Build as a module in Cornerstone Tax (Option A)**

**Rationale:**
- Cornerstone already has User model, Clerk auth, and client management
- Employee data can be shared (tax prep needs the same info)
- Single deployment, single database
- If it grows into a SaaS product, extract later
- For 4 employees, standalone infrastructure is overkill

**Implementation:**
- New models in the existing Rails app
- New React pages/components in the existing frontend
- Payroll-specific routes under `/payroll/`
- Separate service classes for tax calculations

---

## 9. Open Questions

1. **Check stock format** — What check stock does Cornerstone currently use? Pre-printed or blank? What size? (Standard 8.5"×11" with 3-per-page, or individual checks?)
2. **Deductions** — What deductions do they currently withhold beyond taxes? Health insurance? Retirement? Garnishments?
3. **Overtime policy** — Straight federal FLSA (>40 hrs/week = 1.5×), or any Guam-specific rules?
4. **Holiday schedule** — Which holidays are paid? Guam has some unique territorial holidays (e.g., Discovery Day, Liberation Day).
5. **PTO/Sick policy** — Does Cornerstone track PTO/sick time? Need to incorporate that?
6. **Existing employee data** — Are the 4 employees already in the Cornerstone app as users?
7. **Tax table source** — Where does Cornerstone currently get their withholding tables? Guam Dept of Rev & Tax publishes them?
8. **Multi-company timeline** — When do they want to start processing client payroll? That affects Phase 2 urgency.
9. **Build in Cornerstone Tax or this standalone repo?** — PRD recommends as a module in cornerstone-tax, but this repo exists if standalone is preferred.

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Tax calculation errors | Medium | High | Validate against manual calculations for all 4 employees. Cross-reference with IRS Pub 15-T. Build comprehensive test suite. |
| Check formatting issues | Medium | Medium | Get sample checks from Cornerstone. Test on their actual printer. Iterate. |
| Scope creep into Phase 2/3 | High | Medium | Strictly ship Phase 1 for internal use first. Don't build multi-company until internal is proven. |
| Tax table changes mid-year | Low | Medium | Store tax tables as data (not hardcoded). Easy to update when new tables are published. |
| SSN security | Low | High | Encrypt at rest with Rails encrypted attributes. Limit access to admin role only. Never log SSNs. |
